Earlier it used lock to a GPS signal early and would keep a steady connection but now it takes too long and also doesn't keep a steady lock. Also, the step counting is not very accurate as it also adds the steps data from the phone and duplicates the steps when used together. Other issue I have observed is that there is no real time/automatic sync with Google FIT. Need to manually sync every time. Last but not the least, Heart rate data is not shared with Google Fit for some strange reason. Amazfit devices share all the data with Google Fit and the sync is automatic. Please fix these annoying issues and I'll update the rating to 5*. Thanks.",3,65,1,1,0,en,Huawei Health

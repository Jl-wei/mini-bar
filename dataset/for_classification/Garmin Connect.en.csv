"Good overall. Could do with a couple of extra features. For example the Polar app has a feature where you can look at your heart rate and pace at each point in your run as a function of distance (rather than time), which would be useful.

Having just bought Garmin Forerunner 630 I was most disappointed to discover that my phone's Bluetooth is not compatible with my android phone (apparently you need Bluetooth 4.0). I do not have a computer running either Windows or Mac so I have no means to get any of my runs off of my watch...  Update - thanks for the reply Garmin Support :)   Upgraded my phone (it's been an expensive month!) and now it works OK.  Also had to borrow someone's Windows (yuk) machine to do the initial setup so that I can set up the WIFI.  I have upped my initial rating of 1 star to 3. What this application is lacking is the means to set up WIFI connections on the watch (you still have to use Garmin Express on a PC/Mac to do this which kept crashing). I think if Garmin Connect could include this functionality it would be a real plus.,3,0,1,1,0,en,Garmin Connect

"For the most part I really like the app as it works with my samsung smart watch. However i really hope they make a few changes. 1) be able to search the Fav food items. I eat the same stuff and when i ad it to my favs i have to scroll up and down looking for it and its a pain. 2) be able to edit / delete the My Food entries. If you make a mistake you cant change it or delete it. or at least i can't figure out how. so i create the a new version with same name + 2 3) Bar Code Scanner for nutritional information like every other nutrition app already has. This would be awesome and it already exists in several other apps. 4) expand compatible devices to include scales, and BGM that are available today. I have tried to purchase devices that are compatible but the device list seems to be old. I can't seem to find those exact devices now. 5) better integration with MyFitnessPal. I get a discount on my health insurance if i submit my steps and achieve the goals. But the apps do not seem to be compatible with each other. 6) integrate a web app. would be great to be able to go to a web page and have some reporting, like daily calorie count, step counts, trend etc that i can print so i can take to my Dr. and discuss. On the samsung health website they indicate apps with samsung health and devices with samsung health but there is no links to see what those apps and devices are. I really like having all of the information in one place. there are probably a few more improvements I gave this a 3 star. This app has the potential to be the best app out there. There are other apps that have these features and i am considering going to an iphone and iwatch or fitbit watch to be able to use these features.

"Great app and use it daily with the Gear Fit 2...but with new insight enhancements as far as scheduling acivities feature is concerned, I dont understand why it can't do a recurring schedule for days of the week or days other than the current day....this is just stupid.  Other than that...very happy with the app!",4,0,0,1,0,en,Samsung Health
This used to work perfect befor updates but I cant evan get on to it now as it wont let me past the 2 step verification I enter my phone number and the code texted to me so then I click verify and it puts me back to the beginning time and time again I have uninstalled it and then re installed it and it makes no difference,1,0,1,0,0,en,Samsung Health

"Not consistent. Ran it side by side on my old Samsung J7 & my new Realme 8 5G with same data for a week, and at the end of the day while the Samsung registered nearly 2000 steps, on the Realme it didn't even register 100 steps.",3,1,1,0,0,en,Samsung Health
I like the app & don't have too many issues but I'm a shift worker so sometimes the app tries to record my sleep & it's wrong & I don't seem to be able to show that I slept during the day.... Can this be changed or added? There are a lot of shift workers in the world.,4,0,0,1,0,en,Samsung Health

"I connected Samsung Health with my Gear Fit and it's so awesome! My phone is Galaxy M30 and it doesn't support heart-rate or Oxygen sensor but it's not a really big problems! Also the app can record sleeping time pretty accurately, which I love the most about it! Even iPhone Health app doesn't have these cool features like this!",5,0,0,0,1,en,Samsung Health

why the time of the activities is removed?!  Nowadays for me the application is useless because for me timing is the most important thing.  Another thing is I am making about 4 km riding my bicycle Samsung Health recognizes only 1.45 km and It is in not possible to add riding of the bicycle,2,2,1,1,0,en,Samsung Health

"Interface is annoying, especially when trying to turn off the step counter. Walking Mate was much more efficient with a simple ""Start"" and ""Pause"" button that you didn't have to go through settings menus to get to. I also find the layout too busy and cumbersome. The older version with Health Board, Walking Mate, Exercise Mate, etc. was more efficient and less cluttered looking. It's a shame cause I used to hear great things about this app. If there was a way to download and use the older version I would. However, with this new look and changes I just can't give it more than 2 stars.  I don't understand why they changed it to such a mess.",2,0,0,1,0,en,Samsung Health
